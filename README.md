# client-side-ip-grabber

This is a simple website demo that will log ip and other misc things in a discord webhook. You need only replace the webhook link in the javascript.

This code requires **no backend**, so you can have it running on github pages, digitalocean apps, etc. Depending on your browser, it might not work. I've had some issues with firefox arkenfox, but Brave, Edge, and Chrome all should work fine.
