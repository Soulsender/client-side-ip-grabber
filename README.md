# js-tracker-website

This is a simple website demo that will log ip and other misc things in a discord webhook. You need only replace the webhook link in the javascript.

This code requires no backend, so you can have it running on github pages, digitalocean apps, etc. uBlock Origin will block it though, causing it to not work.
